<h2 align="center">Practice with Mongo Database </h2>
<br />
Here I am refactoring online store project from my "expressjs-store" repo. In this project I am practicing to do:

* Connecting Mongoose package (web server)

* Creating Mongoose model

* Creating 'DELETE' button and function from 'CART'

* Creating User Model in Mongo DB

* Creating logic in the 'CART' (add product into cart and delete product from it)

* Creating 'MY ORDERS' page for this online store

* NOTE: to modify this project properly - you need to connect your own Mongo DB Cluster! For running it - feel free to use mine!

### Built with:
* [MONGO DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [MONGOOSE](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

### Prerequisites:

For running this project you need NPM

* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo or download it into your local machine
```sh
https://github.com/vokhlachev/expressjs-store-mongodb.git
```
3. Run NPM in into project folder to get all packages and dependencies from package.json
```sh
npm install 
```
4. Enjoy! :smile:
